    "look_scene" : "You are given with an image of the scene. You need to describe the color of liquids in the scene. If the container is opaque, describe the container only.\nYou are given with an example below.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n[Input Image]\nThere are 10 bottles containing common household liquids in the scene, each surrounded by a red bounding box, and an index number above the box.\nCounting from left to right:\n1. Bottle indexed (0) is opaque, and the container appears to be a can. # This is a valid description as it only described the container when the liquid is not observable\n2. Bottle indexed (1) contains red liquid. # This is a valid description as it only described the color of the liquid\n3. Bottle indexed (2) contains purple liquid with visible pulp. # This description should be avoided as it included more than liquid color description\n...\n10. Bottle indexed (9) contains colorless liquid. # This is a valid description as it only described the color of the liquid.",
    "look_container" : "You are given with an image of a liquid container. You need to describe the liquid. In case the liquid is not visually observable, describe its container only. If there is legible text or symbol on the containers, describe what you can read or observe. Be concise.",
    "shake_container" : "You are given with a time-series plot representing the response of a liquid inside the container after it was moved horizontally by a robot arm. You need to qualitatively estimate the viscosity of the liquid (e.g., low, moderate, or high viscosity).\nConsider the following physical knowledge that provide the descriptions of the response from two liquids with low and high viscosity, which represent the minimum and maximum of the viscosity range you will see in the given plot. Note that the range is inclusive:\nIn the oscillation plot from a low viscosity liquid, you will see peaks with gradually decreasing amplitudes, which appear perfectly sinusoidal until the end the 10-second period.\nIn the oscillation plot from a high viscosity liquid, you will see a large initial peak that immediately transitioned to small fluctuations around zero and do not exhibit a clear sinusoidal pattern until the end of the 10-second period.\n\nYou must reason with the above given knowledge before answering."
