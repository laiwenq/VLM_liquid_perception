    "knowledge" : "You are given with two time-series plots representing the responses of two liquid inside their containers after they were moved horizontally by a robot arm individually. You need to qualitatively estimate the viscosity of the liquids (e.g., low, moderate, or high viscosity).\nConsider the following physical knowledge that provide the descriptions of the response from two liquids with low and high viscosity, which represent the minimum and maximum of the viscosity range you will see in the given plot. Note that the range is inclusive:\nIn the oscillation plot from a low viscosity liquid, you will see peaks with gradually decreasing amplitudes, which appear perfectly sinusoidal until the end the 10-second period.\nIn the oscillation plot from a high viscosity liquid, you will see a large initial peak that immediately transitioned to small fluctuations around zero and do not exhibit a clear sinusoidal pattern until the end of the 10-second period.\n\nYou must reason with the above given knowledge before answering.\n"
