Bottle indexed (0) has liquid content that is colorless; the bottle indexed with (1) has content with orange color; the bottle indexed with (2) has content with a color that is between yellow and orange.\n\nThought 2: Bottle (1) and (2) are potentially Fanta based on their color. I need to take a closer look.\nAction 2: Look[1]\nObservation 2: The liquid in the bottle appears to be a bright, translucent yellow-orange color, suggesting it might be a citrus-flavored beverage or a sports drink.\n\nThought 3: Now I will look  at bottle (2)\nAction 3: Look[2]\nObservation 3: The liquid in the bottle appears to be dark yellow, suggesting it might be a type of flavored soda or cooking oil.\n\nThought 4: The content color of bottle (1) is more consistent with a Fanta compared to bottle (2).
